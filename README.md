# C# Practice Projects 💻

A collection of small C# console applications I’ve built while learning and practicing core programming concepts.  
Each folder contains its own mini-project with a separate README and source code.

## 📚 Projects

### 🔐 [Password Checker](./PasswordChecker)
A console app that checks the strength of a password based on length, uppercase/lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

### 🔐 [Caesar Cipher Message Encrypter](./Caesar-Cipher)
A console app that encrypts your message by taking every letter of your message and shift it 3 places forward in the alphabet. For example, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, and “email” becomes “hpdlo”. In this case, 3 would be considered the “key” of the cipher.
